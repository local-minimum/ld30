STORY
-----

The world has separated onto three planes.
Scattered piecies of what once was a comforting and
predictable whole have become a dangerous place to live in.
There are still a few connections between the emerging worlds.
Just enough to traverse the multi-world to reach the beacon that can
bring them all together again.
